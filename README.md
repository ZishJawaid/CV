I’m Zish, a proactive Full Stack developer looking for a Salesforce software engineering role. I have a strong passion for technology consulting, and would thrive on the opportunity to help businesses navigate their digital transformations, as they strategically adapt and position themselves for success in a post Covid-19 environment.

Before recently graduating from Makers Academy, I ran a successful business trading commodities futures, where my interest in programming was fuelled by my desire to automate parts of my trading system. Prior to that, I graduated with a 1st Class Economics degree from UCL, before embarking on a successful 6 year career in Investment Banking (Lehman Brothers, Dresdner Bank), followed by 5 years in the Public Sector working for HM Treasury.

I am extremely keen to leverage the project management, communication, and collaborative skills I have gained from my unique multi-sector experience, to help create bespoke software solutions that meet specific business and client requirements, whilst still having a positive and tangible impact on people's lives.

## Skills

#### Adaptable and proactive mindset

I believe I am extremely versatile, and have the ability to quickly adapt, and embrace unfamiliar tasks with an inquisitive and enthusiastic mind. I have always looked to step outside of my comfort zone, as evidence by:

- Starting my own successful business trading commodity futures, which required courage, determination and a proactive mindset to overcome numerous hurdles.
- My decision to broaden my horizons by working in Germany, and improve my spoken German from a conversational to a business level at Dresdner Bank.
- Travelling around SE Asia during a sabbatical, teaching English to school children.

#### Team player and strong communicator

- Ability to explain concepts in a clear and concise way, and effectively adjust my communication style depending on whether I was directly briefing the Chancellor at HM Treasury, pairing with my Makers buddy, teaching school children in Japan, or presenting at international conferences for Dresdner Bank.
- Known for my empathetic listening skills and personable nature, as shown by the networks and client relationships I built whilst at Lehman Brothers, Dresdner Bank, and HM Treasury.
- Experience leading, inspiring and managing a diverse range of teams, from traders and economists in both public and private sector settings, to captaining my five-a-side football team to victory in my local league.

#### Business and client focused with proven project management skills

- My prior experience of managing large-scale projects will enable me to contribute effectively to Deloitte’s Agile/Scrum based work flows. I have project managed the front-to-end delivery of a successful 4 day Chancellor visit to the Gulf. This involved chairing stakeholder strategy meetings to scope requirements, pitching the business case directly to the Chancellor, and running 4-day sprints with regular progress meetings. The 6 week project was delivered on time and satisfied departmental budgetary criteria.
- During a two-week group project at Makers, we were tasked with building an Airbnb clone. I persuaded our team to identify and then deliver our MVP by the end of our first 2 day sprint, rather than focus on implementing a number of backend features that a client wouldn’t be able to use in isolation. This improved the team dynamic and morale as the deadlines approached, as we were confident of being able to deliver a viable product to our client at any stage of the development process.

#### Systematic yet innovative problem solver

- Analysed 1000s of trades to identify areas to improve my trading edge and process, requiring discipline and a meticulous attention to detail, a skill I have carried across to my debugging process.
- My analysis showed that my trade entry/exit was sub-optimal under certain market conditions, which led to a revision of my strategy by scaling in to positions and taking profits at predefined levels related to market volatility. This adjustment increased my profit per trade by 5%.

#### Quick learner with a passion for knowledge sharing

- Developed an Android app in 2 weeks using Java, Firebase and Android Studios, a tech stack I had never used before.
- Balanced full-time trading with self-study to learn the fundamentals of using Options as a hedging strategy to minimise the risk exposure of my portfolio, widely known to be a difficult and technical concept.
- Mentored 2 students at Makers and volunteered to run our end-of-week cohort retro for 12 students, providing the opportunity for my peers to reflect on their group projects.
