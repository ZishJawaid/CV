I’m Zish, a proactive Full Stack developer looking for a Salesforce software engineering role. I have a strong passion for technology consulting, and would thrive on the opportunity to help businesses navigate their digital transformations, as they strategically adapt and position themselves for success in a post Covid-19 environment.

Before recently graduating from Makers Academy, I ran a successful business trading commodities futures, where my interest in programming was fuelled by my desire to automate parts of my trading system. Prior to that, I graduated with a 1st Class Economics degree from UCL, before embarking on a successful 6 year career in Investment Banking (Lehman Brothers, Dresdner Bank), followed by 5 years in the Public Sector working for HM Treasury.

I am extremely keen to leverage the project management, communication, and collaborative skills I have gained from my unique multi-sector experience, to help create bespoke software solutions that meet specific business and client requirements, whilst still having a positive and tangible impact on people's lives.
